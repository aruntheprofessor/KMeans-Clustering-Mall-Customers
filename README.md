# KMeans-Clustering-Mall-Customers
# Task 8: Clustering with K-Means

### Objective:
Perform unsupervised learning using K-Means clustering.

### Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

---

### What I Did:

- Loaded the Mall Customer Segmentation dataset.
- Visualized the data.
- Used Elbow Method to find optimal K.
- Applied KMeans clustering.
- Visualized clusters in 2D using color coding.
- Evaluated the clustering using Silhouette Score.

---

### What I Learned:

- How KMeans works in unsupervised learning.
- How to choose the number of clusters using the Elbow method.
- Visualization of clusters.
- Understanding cluster quality using Silhouette Score.
